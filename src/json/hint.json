  "Selects the element with a specific <strong>id</strong>. You can also combine the ID selector with the type selector.",
  "Selects all <strong>B</strong> inside of <strong>A</strong>. <strong>B</strong> is called a descendant because it is inside of another element.",
  "You can combine any selector with the descendent selector.",
  "The class selector selects all elements with that class attribute. Elements can only have one ID, but many classes.",

  "Thanks to Shatner technology, this selects all <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> elements. You can combine any selectors this way, and you can specify more than two.",
  "You can select all elements with the universal selector!",
  "This selects all elements inside of A.",

  "You can select all siblings of an element that follow it. This is like the Adjacent Selector (A + B) except it gets all of the following elements instead of one.",
  "You can select elements that are direct children of other elements. A child element is any element that is nested directly in another element.<br><br>Elements that are nested deeper than that are called descendant elements.",

  "Selects the nth (Ex: 1st, 3rd, 12th etc.) child element in another element.",
  "Selects a specific element based on its type and order in another element - or even or odd instances of that element.",
